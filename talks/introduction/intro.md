# Why?

* Limited Resources.
* Efficiency.
* Just for Fun!

But what is an **algorithm**?

---

# When?

* The **first rule** of optimization is: Don't do it. The **second rule** of optimization is: Don't do it yet.

---

# How to compare them?

* Correct vs Incorrect.
* Well, it depends, suppose we have two algorithms:
  * One works better for large inputs.
  * One works better for small inputs.
  * Which one is better?
* Another sample: Sorting Algorithms:
  * Number of items to be sorted.
  * Are they already somewhat sorted?
  * item values/limits?
* Complexity:
  * Runtime (Temporal)
  * Spatial (Memory)

# Interviews.

* why?
* are they even used in daily work?

---

# But technology has improved!

* Moore's law can't continue forever.
* With better technology, bigger challenges.
* Parallelism.

---

# Big-O notation.

* Next session.
